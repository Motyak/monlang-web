Int?(23)
  -> produces an Optional<Int> with value 23

Int?()
  -> produces an empty Optional<Int>

Int(23)
  -> produces an Int with value 23

Int()
  -> illegal (Int is a type, and therefore its ctor requires exactly one value)
    -> exception: optional types => Int?() produces an empty Optional<Int>

a Struct with no field at all is completely useless
a Struct with only 1 field should be a type (type alias)
