ATOM-QUOTE* -- when we fall-through Atom BUT it starts with the >>'<< character
  -> should then be considered a Quotation (rather than a new individual grammar entity)
  -> we are forced to define it at this level in the grammar because we can't define Quotation based on Atom
     (since Atom isn't defined, it's the fall-through)

ATOM -- fall-through
