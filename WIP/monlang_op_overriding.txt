```
    overriding the builtin `*` operator..
    ..to take advantage of lazy evaluation
```
let * (lhs, rhs, varargs...):{
    [ lhs <> 0 ] || return 0
    var res lhs
    let it ${Stream(rhs, varargs...)}
    do {
        let cur ${next(it)}
        [ cur <> 0 ] || return 0
        ; refers to the builtin operator
        res *= cur
    }
    until [ end?(it) ]
    res
}
