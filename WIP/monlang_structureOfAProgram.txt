Structure of an exhaustive Monlang program:

/* c preprocessor directives (pragma once, include) */

package global

/* top-level statements (user type definitions) */

/* symbol definitions (functions, variables, etc..) */

package main

/* actual program logic */

---

Structure of a simple Monlang program:

/* standalone file means no need for `#pragma once` */

/* no dependencies means no `#include` */

// the `package global` line is optional (its the default package)

// when we elid `package main` line, it stays in package global,
// which means any other file that #include this file will execute
// this file's logic code before its own

// here we don't care because it's a standalone file,
// so it's not going to be included anywhere

/* program definitions and logic */
